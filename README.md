# Async Coder
**_The last AI assistant you'll ever need for coding._**

Async Coder is an **open-source, end-to-end AI coding assistant** built to empower developers with full control, unmatched flexibility, and an **autonomous development pipeline**. Think of it as your **developer co-pilot on steroids** ‚Äî capable of debugging, writing, refactoring, documenting, testing, creating PRs, and even reviewing pull requests, all while learning from every mistake and continuously improving.

Whether you want to use **Claude Code, Gemini CLI, Aider, or our in-house AI**, Async Coder lets you **plug in your own API keys**, switch between engines, or simply run in **Async Mode**, where it autonomously handles your coding tasks **from idea to PR merge**.

üåê **New Web Interface Available!** Experience Async Coder through our modern, AI-powered dashboard with voice input, real-time chat, and comprehensive settings management.

## **Why Async Coder?**

Modern coding assistants are either closed-box SaaS tools or limited single-engine CLI apps. **Async Coder is different:**

- **Open-Source Core** ‚Äì Complete transparency, self-host forever, and contribute to its evolution.  
- **End-to-End Autonomy** ‚Äì With **Async Mode**, it can design, build, debug, test, document, and review code independently.  
- **Multi-Engine Support** ‚Äì Use Claude, Gemini CLI, Aider, or our in-house AI. **Your choice. Your rules.**  
- **Modern Web Interface** ‚Äì Intuitive dashboard with AI chat, voice input, repository integration, and real-time collaboration.
- **Self-Learning Agent** ‚Äì Learns from bugs, fixes, and past projects for better accuracy over time.  
- **Developer-Centric Design** ‚Äì Write test cases, perform code reviews, generate documentation, and manage PRs directly.
- **Secure Authentication** ‚Äì Built with Clerk.js for enterprise-grade user management and security.
- **Future-Ready** ‚Äì Architected to integrate with modern CI/CD pipelines and GitHub Actions.
